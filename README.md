## Why Go?

I like that a few lines of code can spin up something real that other people actually use. Completed a full backend career path covering JS, Node.js and PostgreSQL, and I'm now building with Go which clicked in a way the others didn't.

## Why DevOps?

Watched a YouTuber set up their own Kubernetes server and thought "I want to do that." Turns out building the full pipeline from code to deployment is way more interesting than just one piece of it.
